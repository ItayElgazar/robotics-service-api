# Robotics Manager Api

##### What's inside:

- JWT Authentication (I choosed JWT cause it's simpler to use, it can be used across all services, and more...)
- The option to manage robot (add, delete and get) robots
- The option to execute a robot's mission for each robot with a queue list by order
- I comment where it's necessary. In general I don't like to use comments for everything I do. 
clear code should be readable :) 

##### Whats left to be done:
- Testing
- Fixing the docker image
- Thinking about edge cases
